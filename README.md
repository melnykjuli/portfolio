# PORTFOLIO

## About me

My name is Yuliia Melnyk, and I would like to express my willingness to speed up my career-switching process and become a QA Engineer.
Â 
Over the past three years, while I've worked as a technical recruiter, I've sharpened my communication skills in interviews, fine-tuned my presentation experience, and improved my understanding of nuances of the software development process.

Additionally, the ongoing interaction with developers and overcoming the initial problems on my training projects during the study sessions have provided me a priceless basis for tackling new obstacles.
